# main-driver-setup
Here you can find my current main driver setup using ansible. I wrote a blogpost that goes deeper into it [here](https://theintegrative.net/p/how-my-main-driver-is-setup-with-ansible/). My setups for my drivers moved to gitlab [Driver config](https://gitlab.com/the-integrative-driver-config).
